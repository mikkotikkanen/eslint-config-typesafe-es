## Installation

Install ESLint and type-safe-es configuration preset (plus, itâ€™s peer dependencies):

```bash
npm install eslint eslint-config-type-safe-es eslint-plugin-jsdoc --save-dev
```


## Configuration

Add `.eslintrc.json` that extends the typesafe-es configuration

```json
{
  "extends": ["typesafe-es"]
}
```

__Note:__ If you are using typesafe-es in combination with other configurations, such as
`airbnb-base`, make sure `typesafe-es` is set as last since other configurations might turn some
rules off by default. (Example: `"extends": ["airbnb-base", "typesafe-es"]`)
